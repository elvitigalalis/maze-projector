Maze Drawer
-----------
This script reads a maze from an ASCII text file (formatted like the sample provided),
parses it into a grid of MazeCells (each with boolean walls: north, east, south, west,
and optionally a start (S) or goal (G) marker), and then draws the maze using Pillow.
User input is requested for:
  - The filename of the maze file.
  - The cell side length in pixels.
  - The wall thickness in pixels.

The ASCII file format is expected to have alternating horizontal and vertical wall rows.
For example, for a maze with R rows and C columns, the file has 2*R+1 lines.
- The first line is a horizontal line that begins with an "o" and then has segments of either
  "   " (no wall) or "---" (wall present) between successive "o" characters.
- The next line begins with "|" (or a space) and then, for each cell, has a 3â€‘character interior
  (which may contain S or G) with vertical walls indicated by "|" between cells.
- These two types of lines alternate, and the last line gives the southern walls.
