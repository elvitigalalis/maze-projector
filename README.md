# maze-projector
Micromouse projection-based maze simulation on real floor. In order to replace the arduous (and extremely costly) task of constructing an accurate 16x16 maze, a projector can be used to *project* a maze onto the floor. Trigonometry can be used to accurately map out a projection onto a floor with correct cell/maze dimensions, allowing teams to test out their mouses on mazes *without actually constructing such a maze.* Furthermore, several different mazes can be run in series!

Benefits:
    - several different mazes can be run in series.
    - low cost compared to purchasing materials for actual mazes.
    - highly customizable.
    - efficient to test for mouse speed.
